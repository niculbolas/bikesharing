## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to review Citibike NYC data to pitch a project of opening a similar service in Des Moines Iowa.  The data for the month of August 2019 was used as the weather is favorable for bike riding.  Some data cleaning was performed using Python and Pandas and then several visualization were created using Tableau.

## Results
A link to the story presentation can be found directly below.  No images will be linked here as they can easily be seen on Tableau Public.

The first image shows that during the month of August 2019, the NYC citibike service had a total of 2,344,224 riders.  The next slide provides a breakdown of those rides by gender.  The results were that 1,530,272 were men, 588,432 were women, and the gender of 225,521 was unknown.  From this it is very apparent that the majority of the bike riders were male.

On slide 3, there is a breakdown of the rides times by minute and hour.  From the graph it is easy to see that the peak usage is at 5 minutes with approximately 146,000 of the rides being that duration.  After the peak, the number of rides drops sharply and by the 1 hour mark the graph is nearly horizontal.  From this data, it is easy to see that the average ride time is under 30 minutes for a majority of the rides.

On slide 4, the rides times are broken down by gender.  As was apparent above, men make up majority of the rides.  The graph for men and women have an identical shape as well both peaking out at about 5 minutes.  The unknown gender graph does not have a well defined peak like the other 2, but instead plateaus for a while before joining the others in tending towards 0.

The next slide shows a breakdown of what day of the week and times were popular for rides.  From the graph it is easy to see that during the weekdays there are peaks at 8 am and 5-7pm which would seem to suggest that many people are using the service to ride to and from work.

On slide 6, there is a breakdown of slide 5 by gender.  It is easy to see that men and women both seem to have peak riding at the same time of day but as before the men have the larger share of rides by a good margin.

The final slide breaks down slide 6 by type of subscriber.  From this data it is quite apparent that majority of the riders are subscribers of the service.  It also seems to suggest that non-subscribers tend to see the most usage on the weekends rather than the weekdays.

## Summary

To summarize there are several important conclusions that can be drawn from the given data.
- Men tend to favor the bike riding service more than women.
- Weekdays are more popular than weekends for riding.
  - Peak usage on weekdays occurs at 8 am and 5-7 pm which suggest that many people use the service to commute to work.
  - Subscribers use more during the week while customers have peak riding over the weekend.
- The vast majority of rides are under 30 minutes.

To get a more complete view of the data I would suggest that the 2 additional visualizations here would be useful:
- A breakdown of rides vs. customer ages.  Are the riders young, middle aged, or older?
- A breakdown of rides vs. customer annual income.  Are the riders poor, middle class, rich, or equally distributed?
Knowing some data on these 2 things might provide some additional insight on how to advertise the service in the new proposed city location.
